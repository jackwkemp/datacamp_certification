----------

The information provided below is the outcome of a one-hour live assessment conducted on the DataCamp platform. I have intentionally left my work unedited to highlight my original thought process, reasoning, and problem-solving skills under time constraints.

In addition to the coding assessment, I also prepared a presentation within the allotted timeframe, which has been included here for reference.

Please note that the original dataset used for this assessment is not included as I no longer have access to the file. However, the solutions and presentation provided showcase my analytical approach and problem-solving process in addressing the given challenges.
